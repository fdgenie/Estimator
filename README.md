# Estimator

Estimator is a new feature for our logistic platform. The use of estimator is to provide the service agent an easy way to get the accurate estimate time of arrival(ETA) of shipment and vessel and inform the user if there is any delay. The service agent can also update the shipment arrival date after informing the customer.

# Technology stack

The stack is Vue2 option API, Quasar, Scss, Vuex, Eslint, Prettier and there are e2e test coverage with Cypress.
